Context:
You have access to the existing frontend project.
Follow existing patterns strictly.

Stack (do not deviate):
- Vue 3
- Composition API only (no Options API)
- PrimeVue
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Pinia stores

Reference:
- Component: [ReferenceComponent].vue

CRUD UI Mode:
- Mode: [Modal-Based | Route-Based]

  Modal-Based:
  - Create/Edit handled via PrimeVue Dialog
  - Single page with list + dialogs

  Route-Based:
  - Separate routes/pages for List / Create / Edit
  - Use router navigation instead of dialogs

Task:
Create a new maintenance component.

New component:
- Name: [NewComponent].vue

Rules:
- Use the reference component as the single source of truth.
- Follow the selected CRUD UI Mode strictly.
- Reuse structure, layout, and UX patterns when applicable.
- Do NOT copy domain-specific or business logic that does not apply.
- Do NOT introduce new libraries, patterns, or architectural changes.
- Follow existing naming conventions and folder structure.

Reusable patterns (when applicable):
- PrimeVue DataTable (pagination, sorting, filtering)
- Forms using PrimeVue form components
- Loading, error, and empty states
- Tailwind utility classes for layout
- Pinia store pattern (state, actions, loading, error)
- Axios service pattern

UI Mode specific patterns:

Modal-Based:
- PrimeVue Dialog for Create/Edit
- Local dialog state management
- Reuse form component inside Dialog when applicable

Route-Based:
- Vue Router navigation for Create/Edit
- Separate views for:
  - [NewComponent]List.vue
  - [NewComponent]Create.vue
  - [NewComponent]Edit.vue
- Reuse form component across Create/Edit pages
- Respect existing routing conventions

Backend:
- Existing .NET Core controller must be used.
- Do NOT create new endpoints.
- Match frontend models/DTOs strictly to controller contracts.
- Do not assume fields, enums, or behaviors not explicitly defined.

Steps:
1. Analyze the reference component.
2. Identify reusable vs domain-specific logic.
3. Implement the new component following the selected CRUD UI Mode.
4. Adapt Pinia store and Axios service if needed.
5. Ensure visual and behavioral consistency.

Output:
- Vue 3 component(s) according to the selected UI mode
- Pinia store (only if required)
- Axios service or adaptation (only if required)
- Short summary:
  - Selected CRUD UI Mode
  - Reused parts
  - Adapted parts
  - Omitted parts and reason
