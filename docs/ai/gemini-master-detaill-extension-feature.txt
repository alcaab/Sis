Create a new Vue 3 (Composition API) component that functions as the DETAIL view
in a Master/Detail pattern.

CONTEXT:
- The existing master component is: AcademicYearEdit.vue
- The detail view must display the evaluation periods (EvaluationPeriods)
  associated with the AcademicYear currently being edited.
- The AcademicYearId is already available in AcademicYearEdit.vue
  (prop, route param, or store; reuse the same pattern).

MANDATORY STACK:
- Vue 3 + Composition API
- PrimeVue (DataTable, Column, Button, Dialog if applicable)
- Axios for HTTP calls
- Tailwind for styling
- Pinia stores (if a related store exists, reuse it)
- Same visual style, structure, and conventions as AcademicYearEdit.vue

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. The component must be a list component (detail).
2. Use PrimeVue DataTable to display the evaluation periods.
3. Suggested minimum columns:
   - Name
   - StartDate
   - EndDate
   - IsActive (formatted)
   - Actions (Edit / Delete if applicable)
4. The DataTable must:
   - Support loading state
   - Handle empty lists correctly
   - Have row actions following the same visual pattern as the master

MASTER / DETAIL INTEGRATION:
- The component must receive AcademicYearId from the master
  (prop or composable, following the existing pattern).
- Upon mounting, it must load the periods associated with that AcademicYearId
  using the existing .NET Core controller.
- Do not create new endpoints if they already exist; reuse current ones.

STRUCTURE:
- Suggested component name: AcademicYearEvaluationPeriods.vue
- Place it in the same folder or subfolder where it makes sense
  according to the current project structure.
- Export default with <script setup>.

STYLE AND CONSISTENCY:
- Copy Tailwind classes, layout, spacing, and naming conventions
  from AcademicYearEdit.vue where applicable.
- Do not introduce unnecessary new UI patterns.
- Keep the code clean, readable, and aligned with the project.

DELIVERABLE:
- Complete component code ready to paste.
- Do not include long explanations, just the code.
