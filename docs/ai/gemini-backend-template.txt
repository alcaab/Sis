Context:
You have access to the existing backend project.
Follow existing architecture and conventions strictly.

Stack (do not deviate):
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- CQRS pattern
- FluentValidation
- Riok.Mapperly for mapping
- MediatR (if already used in the project)

Reference:
- EF Core Entity: [EntityName]

Task:
Implement backend support for a new maintenance feature.

Base rules:
- Use the EF Core entity as the single source of truth.
- Do NOT modify the entity unless explicitly requested.
- Follow CQRS separation strictly (Commands vs Queries).
- Do NOT introduce alternative patterns or libraries.

DTO Strategy:
- Create ONE common DTO based on the EF Core entity.
- This DTO must be reused by:
  - Commands
  - Queries
  - Responses (when applicable)
- Do not create duplicated DTOs unless explicitly required.

CQRS Structure:

Commands:
- Create[EntityName]Command
- Update[EntityName]Command
- Delete[EntityName]Command (if applicable)
- Each command must:
  - Use the common DTO
  - Have a dedicated handler
  - Have a FluentValidation validator

Queries:
- Get[EntityName]ByIdQuery
- Get[EntityName]ListQuery
- Each query must:
  - Use the common DTO
  - Support pagination/filtering if already used in the project
  - Have a dedicated handler

Validation:
- Use FluentValidation
- Validation rules must be based on:
  - Entity constraints
  - Business rules visible in the existing codebase
- Do NOT duplicate validation logic inside handlers.

Mapping:
- Use Riok.Mapperly only.
- Create a mapper for:
  - Entity ↔ DTO
  - DTO ↔ Command (if needed)
- Do NOT use AutoMapper or manual mapping.

Persistence:
- Use EF Core DbContext directly inside handlers or via repositories,
  depending on existing project conventions.
- Do NOT introduce new persistence abstractions.

Steps:
1. Analyze the EF Core entity.
2. Define the common DTO.
3. Implement Commands and their handlers.
4. Implement Queries and their handlers.
5. Add FluentValidation validators.
6. Add Mapperly mapper.
7. Ensure consistency with existing conventions.

Output:
- Common DTO
- Commands + Handlers
- Queries + Handlers
- FluentValidation validators
- Mapperly mapper
- Brief summary:
  - What was generated
  - How the DTO is reused
  - Any assumptions made
