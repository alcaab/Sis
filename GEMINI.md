## Gemini Added Memories
- The user wants me to only commit when explicitly asked to.
- All code comments must be in English unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the user.
- When starting a new session, I must always search for an existing work log file (e.g., AI_WORK_LOG.md) and read its content to understand the project status and context.
- When starting a new session, I must explicitly confirm to the user that I have read the memories.
- CRITICAL STARTUP PROTOCOL: 1. IMMEDIATELY upon starting a session, check for `AI_WORK_LOG.md` in the root. 2. READ `AI_WORK_LOG.md` automatically. Do NOT wait for a user prompt. 3. State clearly: 'I have read the work log and I am ready.'
